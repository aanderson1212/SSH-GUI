# SSH-GUI
A simple python SSH local file manager
---------------------------------------------

Easy to use and connect
-------------------------
Most of the buttons are fairly self explanatory. 

This is designed for local file management between machines via ssh.

When connected to a machine, click "list files" to see the base directory. (I plan to add a better file brower system, along with folder upload/download)

---------------------------------------------

Updates will comes as needed
